# The Monty Hall Problem


.pull-left[
### The problem
Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, revealing a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

### Marilyn weighs in

Marilyn vos Savant of *Parade* magazine famously responded by instructing the contestant to switch. Switching, she reasoned, doubles the probability of winning: $Pr[car|switch] = 2/3$; $Pr[car|stay] = 1/3$

### Your challenge

> Write and execute a computer simulation to evaluate Marilyn's claim. Present a table showing the number of simulated games won by the contestant who chose to switch and the number won by the contestant who stayed. Present the same information in a bar chart for good measure. Are your findings consistent with Marilyn's arguments? Is it better to switch?

# Installing packages

- `install.packages`: function that pulls and unpacks files from CRAN

- Packages contain a library of functions (and underlying code)

- Install once. Never again.

- To use functions from a package: 
  - `library(packname)` 
  - `require(packname)` (for writing functions)
  - `packname::function` (access on the fly)
