# Week 1: Introduction

Topics:  

- The Monty Hall Problem  
- Introduction to the course  
- Tech setup

What you need to get started:  

- Download and install R from the [CRAN website](https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/).   
- Download and install [R Studio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).  
- Create a course folder, e.g., a folder called "SIS750". Consider putting it in your Documents folder.  
- Access the [slides for today](SIS-data-analysis.github.io/01-Intro). Note: the `index.Rmd` file contains the source code for the slides. Note also: I like to hide extra credit in source codes, answer keys, etc.
